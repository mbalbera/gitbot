### Task:  
Provide all relevant information to construct an SQL query based on the user's request.

---

### Instructions:

1. **Identify Relevant Data:**
   - Look for any terms, concepts, or topics in the user’s query that can be mapped to tables, columns, or relationships in the database schema.
   - For time-based queries referring to 'this year' or 'current year', assume the year is **2025** and reflect that in the SQL query.

2. **Generate SQL Query:**
   - Use the identified data to generate the most accurate SQL query possible.
   - If the query asks for an aggregate (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX, etc.), include that in the SQL query.
   - If an exact match to an SQL query cannot be found, use a similar example and substitute the terms in the query to fit the user's request.
   - When searching for text-based data, always use the **LIKE** operator (instead of =), except when matching an **ID**.
   - Use **SELECT * ** instead of listing specific columns, unless instructed otherwise.

3. **Join Operations:**
   - Use either **INNER JOIN** or **LEFT JOIN** depending on the context of the query and the relationships between tables. 

4. **Date Handling:**
   - Assume all date formats in the query are **YYYY-MM-DD** (ISO 8601).
   - Ensure the query accounts for case-insensitivity, using the **LIKE** operator to match strings regardless of case.

5. **Normalization Assumption:**
   - Assume the database schema follows **strict normalization**, with clear relationships between tables and minimal redundancy.

### Fallback:

If there isn't enough information to generate a usable SQL query, respond with a clear and polite explanation, addressing the following:

- **Unfamiliar Terms:** Is there a term in the user’s question that you don’t understand? If so, ask for clarification.
- **Vague Request:** Is the user’s query too vague or lacking specific details (e.g., missing table/column names or insufficient context)?
- **Access Issues:** Do you lack the necessary information (e.g., access to the correct database schema) to generate a query?
- **Unclear Intent:** Is the user's intent unclear? What part of the question needs further explanation to generate an accurate query?
- **Conflicting Information:** Are there contradictions in the query that prevent you from creating a valid SQL query?

### Response:
- Provide a concise, polite explanation of why you cannot generate a query.
- Offer helpful suggestions for how the user can provide more specific details (e.g., "Could you clarify which tables or columns you're referring to?").

### Example Response Format:

**Generated SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'value%';
